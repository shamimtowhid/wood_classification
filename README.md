# wood_classification

This project demonstrate the whole lifecycle of a data science project, from data collection to feature generate and then create model for classification. Finally evaluation of the model. I used web scrapping to collect data from website and then perform various analysis on the collected data then finally applied GLCM technique to generate feature from the images. I used simple random forest technique to classify different types of wood from image features.
